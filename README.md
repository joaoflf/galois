## ðŸ’¡ What is Galois?

A basic document store that can store, retrieve, and query JSON documents using a custom query language.

This project is part of the application of my learnings from the excellent book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/), and it involves:

* Creating a storage mechanism for JSON documents.
* Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for JSON documents.
* Designing and implementing a custom query language to search and filter documents based on their properties.
